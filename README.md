# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Inspiration
Navigating the world of careers can be overwhelming for students, especially when conventional platforms like MyBlueprint fail to provide a comprehensive and engaging exploration of job areas. The process of researching each job individually can be tedious and ineffective. Our solution is to bridge this gap by offering a vibrant, centralized platform that introduces students to a wide array of professions in an interactive and captivating way. We aim to simplify the journey of understanding various career paths and make it more approachable for young students.

Our target audience includes educators and students in grades 7 through 9. By consulting with educators and analyzing the needs of these students, we aim to create an experience that resonates with their curiosity and enthusiasm.

## What it does
CareerNav. is a web app that transforms career exploration into an exciting adventure. Our platform features comprehensive career profiles that offer detailed insights into various professions. Students can explore job descriptions, required skills, and typical work environments through interactive elements such as infographics, visuals, and short videos that keep the content engaging and dynamic.

In addition, our interactive career quiz and games are designed to help students uncover careers that align with their interests, skills, and personalities. With engaging questions and immediate feedback, the quiz not only makes career discovery fun but also provides valuable career suggestions tailored to each studentâ€™s unique profile.

CareerNav. not only helps students explore a wide range of career options but also offers a personalized touch with its favorite feature. This functionality allows students to easily save and keep track of the careers that intrigue them the most. By storing their favorites, students can easily revisit and reflect on their interests, making it simpler to make informed decisions about their future paths.

Additionally, CareerNav. enhances the exploration experience with a dynamic and youthful color palette. This vibrant design element is more than just visually appealing; it inspires and energizes students as they delve into different career options. The engaging colors and visuals create an inviting atmosphere that encourages students to explore, learn, and connect with their future possibilities in a fun and interactive way.

## How we built it
Our journey began with prototyping in Figma, where we mapped out our ideas and envisioned the user experience. We then transitioned to implementing our design using React and Tailwind CSS, bringing our concept to life with a focus on functionality and aesthetic appeal.

## Challenges we ran into
Embarking on this project was a learning curve as it was our first time working with React and Tailwind CSS. Initially, our lack of experience posed challenges, and we faced limitations in achieving our desired outcomes. Despite these hurdles, we embraced the learning process and pushed through to refine our skills and deliver a functional product.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of the fact that we have successfully developed a product from scratch. Our collaborative efforts and shared passion led to the creation of CareerNav., a project we are genuinely excited about. The design and functionality reflect our hard work and teamwork, and we cherish the experience of coming together to create something meaningful.

## What we learned
Through this project, we acquired valuable skills in React and Tailwind CSS, gaining a deeper understanding of web application development. We were inspired by the support and insights from mentors, judges, and fellow hackers, motivating us to continue pursuing our goals and refining our skills in the tech field.

## What's next for CareerNav.
Looking ahead, we plan to complete the remaining components of CareerNav., including adjusting the screen layout to ensure compatibility with various devices. Following this, we will integrate an AI chatbot and develop a mobile app version to enhance user interaction and accessibility. Future updates will focus on incorporating user feedback to further personalize and improve the career exploration experience, making it more effective and engaging for students. Additionally, we aim to introduce forums and user accounts, enabling students to interact with each other and share their career exploration journeys.
